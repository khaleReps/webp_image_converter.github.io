# imageconverter

Convert images to different formats completely on the client

## motivation

looking all over the web for an image conversion website that is free and is not limited the amount of files you can upload

## building

This runs entirely on the client using canvas to draw and then save. 

just use any static file web server or even just drag the file into your browser to view.
